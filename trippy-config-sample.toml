# Sample config file for Trippy.
#
# Copy this template config file to your platform specific config dir.
#
# Trippy will attempt to locate a `trippy.toml` or `.trippy.toml` config file
# in one of the following platform specific locations:
#   the current directory
#   the user home directory
#   the user config directory
#
# For example, on Linux the Trippy will attempt to locate the following
# files (in order):
#   `./trippy.toml`
#   `./.trippy.toml`
#   `$HOME/trippy.toml`
#   `$HOME/.trippy.toml`
#   `$HOME/.config/trippy.toml`
#   `$HOME/.config/.trippy.toml`
#
# See https://github.com/dirs-dev/dirs-rs for platform specific directory
# information.
#
# You may override the config file name and location by passing the `-c`
# (`--config-file`) command line argument.
#
# All sections and all items within each section are non-mandatory.
