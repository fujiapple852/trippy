# Sample config file for Trippy.
#
# Copy this template config file to your platform specific config dir.
#
# Trippy will attempt to locate a `trippy.toml` or `.trippy.toml` config file
# in one of the following locations:
#   the current directory
#   the user home directory
#   the XDG config directory (Unix only): `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `~/.config`
#   the Windows data directory (Windows only): `%APPDATA%`
#
# You may override the config file name and location by passing the `-c`
# (`--config-file`) command line argument.
#
# All sections and all items within each section are non-mandatory.
