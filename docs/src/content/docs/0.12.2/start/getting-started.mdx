The following steps will guide you through the process of installing and running Trippy.

<Steps>

1. Install Trippy:

    Trippy runs on Linux, BSD, macOS, and Windows. It can be installed from most common package managers, precompiled binaries, or source.

    For example, to install Trippy from `cargo`:

    ```shell
    cargo install trippy --locked
    ```

    See the [installation guide](/0.12.2/start/installation) for details of how to install Trippy on your system.

2. Run Trippy:

   To run a basic trace to `example.com` with default settings, use the following command:

   ```shell
   sudo trip example.com
   ```

   See the [usage examples](/0.12.2/guides/usage) and the [CLI reference](/0.12.2/reference/cli) for details of how to use Trippy.  To use Trippy without elevated privileges, see the [privileges guide](/0.12.2/guides/privileges).

3. Customize the key bindings, theme and columns:

   See the [key bindings reference](/0.12.2/reference/bindings), [theme reference](/0.12.2/reference/theme) and [column reference](/0.12.2/reference/column) for details of how to customize the appearance and behavior of Trippy.

   These settings can be made permanent by adding them to the Trippy configuration file, see the [configuration reference](/0.12.2/reference/configuration) for details.
