/// the length field of the IP header is inconsistent between operating
/// systems and operating system versions.  FreeBSD 11 requires the length
/// field in network byte order, but some older versions of FreeBSD
/// require host byte order.  OS X requires the length field in host
/// byte order.  Linux will accept either byte order."
