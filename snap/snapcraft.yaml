name: trippy
version: '0.13.0-dev'
summary: A network diagnostic tool
description: |
  Trippy combines the functionality of traceroute and ping and is designed to 
  assist with the diagnosis of network issues.
  
  Features:
  
  - Trace using multiple protocols:
  - `ICMP`, `UDP` & `TCP`
  - `IPv4` & `IPv6`
  - Customizable tracing options:
      - packet size & payload pattern
      - start and maximum time-to-live (TTL)
      - minimum and maximum round duration
      - round end grace period & maximum number of unknown hops
      - source & destination port (`TCP` & `UDP`)
      - source address and source interface
      - `TOS` (aka `DSCP + ECN`)
  - Equal Cost Multi-path Routing strategies (`classic`, `paris` and `dublin`)
  - RFC4884 ICMP Multi-Part Messages
    - Generic Extension Objects
    - MPLS Label Stacks
  - Unprivileged mode
  - NAT detection
  - Tui interface:
      - Trace multiple targets simultaneously from a single instance of Trippy
      - Per hop stats (sent, received, loss%, last, avg, best, worst, stddev, jitter & status)
      - Per hop round-trip-time (RTT) history and frequency distributing charts
      - Interactive chart of RTT for all hops in a trace with zooming capability
      - Interactive GeoIp world map
      - Isolate and filter by individual tracing flows
      - Customizable color theme & key bindings
      - Customizable column order and visibility
      - Configuration via both command line arguments and a configuration file
      - Show multiple hosts per hop with ability to cap display to N hosts and show frequency %
      - Show hop details and navigate hosts within each hop
      - Freeze/unfreeze the Tui, reset the stats, flush the cache, preserve screen on exit
      - Responsive UI with adjustable refresh rate
      - Hop privacy
  - DNS:
      - Use system, external (Google `8.8.8.8` or Cloudflare `1.1.1.1`) or custom resolver
      - Lazy reverse DNS queries
      - Lookup [autonomous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)) number (ASN) and name
  - GeoIp:
      - Lookup and display GeoIp information from local [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com) and [IPinfo](https://ipinfo.io) `mmdb` files
  - Generate tracing reports:
      - `json`, `csv` & tabular (pretty-printed and markdown)
      - Tracing `flows` report
      - Graphviz `dot` charts
      - configurable reporting cycles
  - Runs on multiple platform (macOS, Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD, Windows)
  - Capabilities aware application (Linux only)
  
  This package auto-connects to the following snap interfaces:
  
    - `network`: to allow general outgoing network access
    - `network-bind`: to allow binding to local ports
    - `network-observe`: to allow enabling `CAP_NET_RAW` for using raw sockets
    - `home`: to allow access to /home for reading the configuration file
